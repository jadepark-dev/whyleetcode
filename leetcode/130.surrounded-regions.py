# Testcase Example:  '[["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]'
#
# Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that
# are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
#
# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded
# region.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: board =
# [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
# Output:
# [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
# Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
# - It is on the border, or
# - It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
# The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
# The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: board = [["X"]]
# Output: [["X"]]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# m == board.length
# n == board[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 200
# board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
#
