# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,4]\n[1,3,4]'
#
# You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
# 
# Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing
# together the nodes of the first two lists.
# 
# Return the head of the merged linked list.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
#
