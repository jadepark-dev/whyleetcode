#
# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
# house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you
# from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems
# connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses
# were broken into on the same night.
# 
# Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house,
# return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the
# police.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
# Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
# Output: 12
# Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5
# (money = 1).
# Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 100
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 400
# 
# 
#
